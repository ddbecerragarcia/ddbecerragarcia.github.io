                <p>Hello, my name is Daine Becerra Garcia. I am currently a senior at the University of San Francisco, majoring in design, with plans to graduate in the Spring of 2024.</p>
                    
                <p>From a young age, I liked being creative and one day the church I attend needed 
                someone to help make flyers for an event, so I thought that I would give it a shot. 
                I started making flyers through Canva, a template-based design program, 
                but as I learned more and more about design I thought I should try making my 
                own designs from scratch. Since then, Iâ€™ve learned so much, and to this day 
                I keep learning new things. I am passionate about design and in the future, 
                I hope to work in product design or graphic design.</p>
                    
                <p>Outside of design, I love photography. I started taking photos for fun and 
                doing small photo shoots with friends and family and I loved taking photos. 
                This is something that I would love to pursue in the future.</p>
